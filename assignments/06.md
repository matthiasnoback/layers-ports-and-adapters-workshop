# A hidden dependency on the persistence mechanism

We have removed the "code" dependency to a particular persistence mechanism, but we're still dependent on the persistence mechanism to return an identifier for new `Meetup` objects.

- Remove that dependency by providing an ID instead of waiting for one to come back from the "database".
- Create the ID in the web and CLI controller, and make sure it is passed along to deeper layers.

## Hints

- Use `Uuid::uuid4()` to generate a unique identity.
- Use `Uuid::toString()` to convert the ID object to a string.
- Wrap that string inside a `MeetupId` object.
