# A hidden dependency on the persistence mechanism

We have removed the "code" dependency to a particular persistence mechanism, but we're still dependent on the persistence mechanism to return an identifier for new `Meetup` objects.

- Remove that dependency by providing an ID instead of waiting for one to come back from the "database".
- Create the ID in the web and CLI controller, and make sure it is passed along to deeper layers.

## Hints

- Use `Uuid::uuid4()` to generate a unique identity.
- Use `Uuid::toString()` to convert the ID object to a string.
- You can use the existing `MeetupId` class, which can be created based on the uuid string.
- It's recommended to not create `MeetupId`'s wherever you like, but instead let the `MeetupRepository` handle it. Traditionally, a repository has a `nextIdentity()` method for that, which simply returns a new `MeetupId` instance. This way, the construction logic of identifiers can be nicely encapsulated.
- The `MeetupRepository` shouldn't manually call `Meetup::setId()` anymore. Remove this code from the `Meetup` entity and remove the corresponding lines from the `MeetupRepositoryTest` too.
