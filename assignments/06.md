# Different types of tests

Make a proper division in `test/` based on the types of tests this project has, i.e. 

- functional tests,
- acceptance tests, 
- integration tests, 
- and unit tests.

## Hints:

- You can define multiple PHPUnit test suites in `phpunit.xml.dist`.
- You can use different namespaces under `Tests` to mark the difference between types of tests.
