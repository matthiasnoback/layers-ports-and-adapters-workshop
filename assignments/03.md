# Input adapters

For the *UserInterface* port we want *Web* and *Cli* adapters which don't duplicate application or domain logic. Introduce a service that handles the "Schedule meetup" use case, which can be invoked by both the `ScheduleMeetupController` and the `ScheduleMeetupConsoleHandler`.

Next, apply the [Introduce Parameter Object](http://refactoring.com/catalog/introduceParameterObject.html) to the service call.

You'll end up with something that's known as a *command* and a *command handler*.

## Hints

- You may leave out the part where the form data gets validated. We'll fix this in the next assignment.
