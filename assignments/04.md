# Input validation

Find a generic way to validate the command. Keep in mind that this isn't the same as protecting domain invariants. It's simply meant to provide user-friendly feedback before accepting the command.

## Hints

- You could implement the validation inside the command class in more or less the same way as it is currently done inside the web controller.
